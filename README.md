# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I completed a Frontend Mentor challenge thatâ€™s perfect for learning to interact with 3rd-party APIs. Using the Advice Slip API, I built a project that generates random quotes of advice. This exercise was a great way to enhance my skills in integrating APIs and handling dynamic content.


**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
